RELEASE: $Date: 2004/08/03 20:27:44 $ ($Revision: 1.36 $)

This is the TODO FILE, so the QLDAPINSTALL file gets a bit cleaner.
This file is NOT structured!!

NEWS:

 see QLDAPNEWS

TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
done    - The big qmail-ldap picture
ongoing - full code review by a third person
planned - make it possible to have locals and rcpthosts in ldap
          and perhaps also the rules for the tcpserver (certs?)
          some people refer to this as ldap-control

PS: planned means we see the use of the idea but there are a lot more
    important things that need to be done first.

ALSO ON THE LIST: (priority list)
- update qmail-ldaplookup (mainly ldap login, passwd check and group handling)
- cleanup the debug code, unify the debug levels
- cleanup failures (hard vs. temporary)
- use pbstools for enhanced tarpit idea
- make full example for qmailaccountpurge.sh
- docu cleanup
- address rewriting (envelope only)

older stuff still on the list:
- add more and clearer documentation.
- benchmarking the code
- better TLS support (better written??) (tls for pop???)
- 64bit counters for quota handling code.

status unclear:
- force to alias if only mail and mailforwardingaddress is set (no uid). (done)
- test what happens if only uid and mail is defiend in ldap or similar uncommon
  cases (seems to be no problem, or?)
