HOW DOES IT WORK

 From http://www.lifewithqmail.org/ldap:
    As we all know, SMTP does not contain any authentication mechanisms by
    default. So in practice you are allowing relaying through your server only
    for some IP addresses, normally your corporate network. If your users are
    coming from various, dynamic IP addresses they can't use your mailserver
    for sending :-((
    
    To overcome this limitation there are 3 possibilities:
    
    -  relaying based on the envelope sender - a really bad idea, easy to abuse.
    -  SMTP AUTH - great, but your clients need to support it. For a patch see
       http://www.lifewithqmail.org/ldap
    -  POP-before-SMTP - when the user gets his mail through pop3 or imap, his
       IP address is recorded and the permission to relay is given for this IP
       for a defined time.
    
    SMTP AUTH would be the best solution as username and password are supplied
    when sending, but as long as too many clients are lacking support for it,
    this is not an option for most of us.
    
 Most POP-before-SMTP solutions use the tcpserver tcprules cdb file to
 store the allowed IP addresses. This does not work in a clustered setup.
 Our solution uses two clients pbsadd and pbscheck and a server pbsdbd which 
 stores the IP addresses in a database.
 pbsadd has to be added just after auth_pop or auth_imap and will add new
 allowed IP addresses to the cache.
 pbscheck runs before qmail-smtpd and sets the RELAYCLIENT environment if the
 IP address is allowed to relay.
 pbsdbd is the Pop-Before-Smtp DataBase Daemon. pbsdbd uses a similar cache 
 algorithm as djbdns' dnscache daemon.
 pbsadd and pbscheck communicate over UDP with the pbsdbd server.
 
================================================================================

INSTALL

 The Tools pbsadd, pbscheck and pbsdbd are installed in the qmail binary
 directory, normally /var/qmail/bin.
 
 NOTE: the tools can also be used on qmail systems without the qmail-ldap patch.
 
================================================================================

CONFIG FILES

~control/pbsservers
 
 A list of IP addresses of running pbsdbd servers.
 This file is only used by the clients pbsadd and pbscheck.
 Required
 Example:
   127.0.0.1
   10.0.1.1
   10.0.2.1
 
~control/pbsip
 
 The pbsdbd server's address is given through this control file.
 This file is only needed for the pbsdbd server.
 Default: 0.0.0.0
 Example: 127.0.0.1
 
~control/pbsport

 The port where all pbsdbd servers are listening on.
 This file if used is needed by all pbs tools and has to be in sync on all
 cluster machines. 
 Default: 2821
 Example: 6666
 Note: Ports > 1024 should be used so that the pbsdbd server can be run
       unprivileged.
 
~control/pbssecret

 Shared secret used by pbsadd and pbsdbd to authenticate the client.
 Required for pbsdbd and pbsadd.
 Example: mekmitasdigoat
 
~control/pbscachesize

 Size in bytes used for the cache. Normally you do not need to set this
 because the default value is big enough.
 Default: 1048576 /* equal to 1 MB */

~control/pbstimeout
 
 Timeout in seconds until entries in the cache are invalidated.
 Only used by the pbsdbd server.
 Default: 600
 Example: 900
 
~control/pbsenv

 Additional environment variables to include.
 pbscheck will set these variables to the values pbsadd returned.
 It is possible to rewrite the variables. A line like
 USER=TCPREMOTEINFO will cause pbscheck to set the environment TCPREMOTEINFO
 to the value set as USER in pbsadd. If you like to prepend some identifier
 in front of the value you can this like this:
 USER=TCPREMOTEINFO=[pbs]   this will add [pbs] in front of the value returned
 by pbsadd.
 Multiline.
 Default: none
 Example: HOST
          TCPREMOTEIP=FROMIP
          USER=TCPREMOTEINFO=[pbs]
          AUTHORIZED=pbs
          

================================================================================

SETUP

pbsadd:
  usage: pbsadd subprogram ...
  
  pbsadd will try to add the IP address $TCPREMOTEIP to all pbsdbd servers
  listed in ~control/pbsservers. Afterward the subprogram with its arguments
  is started.
  On non fatal errors the subprogram will be started without successfully 
  update the database on the pbsdbd servers.
  
pbscheck:
  usage: pbscheck subprogram ...
  
  pbscheck checks if the IP address $TCPREMOTEIP is allowed to relay.
  It will send queries to the pbsdbd servers listed in ~control/pbsservers.
  The first query will be sent to a randomly chosen server, if this timeouts
  all servers will be tried one after another.
  If the IP is allowed to relay the environment $RELAYCLIENT is set.
  On non fatal errors the subprogram will be started without setting
  $RELAYCLIENT.
  
pbsdbd:
  usage: pbsdbd
  
  pbsdbd will listen on address specified in ~control/pbsip and the port 
  specified in ~control/pbsport (default 2821).
  IP addresses will only be added to the cache if the secret specified in
  ~control/pbssecret is included in the add request.

================================================================================

EXAMPLES

 First create all necessary ~control files.
 
 NOTE: the following shell scripts are not finished. You have to edit them to
 modify them for your needs.
 
 The pbsdbd should be run as unprivileged user, this can be done with setuidgid.
 
 #!/bin/sh
 setuidgid qmaild pbsdbd
 
 pbsadd has to be run after auth_pop, auth_imap or checkpassword in the pop3 or
 imap tool chain.
 
 #!/bin/sh
 tcpserver 0 110 qmail-popup $HOST auth_pop pbsadd qmail-pop3d ./Maildir/
 
 
 pbscheck has to be run before qmail-smtpd.
 
 #!/bin/sh
 tcpserver -x $SMTPRULES -v -u qmaild -g nofiles 0 25 pbscheck qmail-smtpd
 

END :-)
